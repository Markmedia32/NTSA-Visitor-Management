🏢 NTSA Visitor Management System
Overview

The NTSA Visitor Management System (VMS) is a secure, web-based application developed to manage and monitor visitors accessing the 7th, 8th, and 9th floors of the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) headquarters.
The system digitizes the process of issuing Visitor Access Cards, enhances security through biometric gate control, and streamlines visitor data management in compliance with building regulations.

This project was developed using Node.js, React, CSS, and SQL — combining performance, usability, and data integrity for efficient visitor management.

🚀 Core Features

Visitor Registration & Card Issuance – Capture visitor details and issue a digital or physical visitor card for gate access.

Biometric Gate Integration – Ensures only verified visitors can access designated NTSA floors.

Blacklist Module – Restrict access to visitors who violate building policies or security protocols.

Visitor Log Management – Track entry and exit times, assigned floors, and purpose of visit.

User Authentication & Role-Based Access – Secure login for administrators, security officers, and receptionists.

Automated Visitor Checkout – Simplifies exit processes and updates visitor status in real-time.

Search & Reporting Tools – View, filter, and export visitor data based on date, purpose, or floor.

Citizen Record Integration (Planned) – Designed to connect with the E-Citizen API for real-time national ID verification (integration managed by NTSA’s senior developer).
